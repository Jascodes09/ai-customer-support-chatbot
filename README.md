## 📌 Problem Statement

E-commerce companies face large volumes of repetitive customer service queries such as:

- “Where is my order?”
- “How do I return a product?”
- “Can I get a refund?”

These repetitive tasks overwhelm human agents, increase response times, and affect customer satisfaction.

## 💡 AI-Powered Solution

Using **Hugging Face Spaces**, I tested a chatbot built on a ChatGPT-like model to handle:
- Order tracking inquiries
- Return and refund questions
- Basic customer support without coding

It responds naturally and asks for relevant information like:
> “Can you provide your order number?”  
> “Where did you purchase the product?”  
> “Is the item used or unopened?”
